## How to use ?
- first you need to import the script , like this :
```python
import functions
```
you can find an example on ``test.py``

- now you can use the functions :
```
import functions as fn

var = fn.encrypt("hello", 2)
print(var)
```
you can see "hello" is the string that we want to encrypt , and "2" is the key, done !
you can print the output to see what will happen !
