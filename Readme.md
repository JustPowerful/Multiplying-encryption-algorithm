# About the project :
- the idea is not totally mine , my friend asked me if i can make an encryption algorithm to challenge the group to decrypt it , it was fun , i sent them "hello world" encrypted and decrypted and i told them to decrypt a another phrase .
- the project is not totally completed you'll find some errors and bugs , if you want to report bugs just use [Issues Report](https://github.com/JustPowerful/Multiplying-encryption-algorithm/issues) 
- you can also contribute to make the project more and more better !

## How to use ?
- first you need to import the script , like this :
```python
import functions
```
you can find an example on ``test.py``

- MEA Encryption Method :
```
import functions as fn

var = fn.encrypt("hello")
print(var)
```

- MEA Decryption Method :
```
import functions as fn

var = fn.decrypt("ÐÊØØÞ")
print(var)
```
